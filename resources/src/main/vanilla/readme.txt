Tinsel generates custom fonts based on vanilla files to allow for higher vertical offsets than usual.
These files are not included in the repo for copyright reasons, and can all be found in the game's assets folder:
- assets/minecraft/textures/font/accented.png
- assets/minecraft/textures/font/ascii.png
- assets/minecraft/textures/font/nonlatin_european.png
